Physical address:
	is used to describe addresses that are accessible in the main memory unit. They are physically
	there in the real memory. Due to memory limitations, it usually only contains the programs that
	are now running. Physical addresses cannot be accessed by the user. The Memory Management Unit
	(MMU) accesses them through the memory bus. It is restricted by the amount of available
	physical memory.
	
Virtual address:
	is used to describe addresses generated by the CPU while executing a program during compile time.
	They are used as a reference to access the physical address. They are not real memory locations,
	but rather just an illusion. They can be much bigger than the physical memory available. They get
	mapped to physical addresses during runtime. The user can access virtual addresses.
