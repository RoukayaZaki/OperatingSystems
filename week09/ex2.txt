5 page frames:

Sequence with high hit/miss ratio:
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
	Hits: 9, Misses: 1
	Hits/Misses = 9.00000

Pages that have been recently used would likely be in the page table, that makes accessing them repeatedly 
most likely causes hits.

Sequence with low hit/miss ratio:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
	Hits: 0, Misses: 30
    Hits/Misses = 0.000000

Pages that are accessed at more distant intervals than the number of page frames will most likely not be in 
the page table, resulting in a miss.

This results from the principle of time locality.
