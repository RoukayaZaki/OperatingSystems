The number specified for the permission is in octal, and the individual bits correspond to the rwx permission for each user type.
For example:
          rwx
    - 0 = 000   -> means no permissions (can't read/write/execute)
    - 7 = 111   -> means have all permissions (can read/write/execute)
    - 5 = 101   -> means have permission to read and execute only (can't write)

For each file/directory you can change the permissions using an octal number of 3 digits, where each digit represents the rwx permissions 
for user(owner), group, and others, respectively.
