In the first run with n = 10,000,000 and m = 1;
we have only 1 thread to calculate number of primes in [0, 10000000)
thus, the time complexity is O(n*sqrt(n)) which took approximately 12s.

In the following runs,
the time taken to calculate the result is theoretically supposed to be the time of the 
first run / number of threads due to concucurrency provided by the creation of threads until 
the number of threads passes a certain threshold and thread creation overhead exceeds the time
compensated.
