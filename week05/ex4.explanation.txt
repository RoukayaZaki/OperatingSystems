The time consumed in ex3 and ex4 are approximately the same but there is a small difference for
cases where number of threads > 1. ex4 can be more efficient than ex3 as in ex4 the distribution
is more balanced than ex3. In ex3, the first thread working on the  first interval would work on
the first small numbers while the last one would work on the largest numbers which will take more
time to deal with. However, the distribution in ex4 is more fair as all thread work together on the
interval as a whole. 

Exception in last run:
Time in ex3 < ex4. This happened because in ex4 there is a queue of other threads will be waiting
for the lock to be unlocked and take their turn.
